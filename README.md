# Sudoku Solver
A TypeScript application that can solve a sudoku puzzle of generic size. It attempts to solve the puzzle in the same way a person might: by attempting to fill out squares in the order of how many possible solutions they could have, given the current puzzle state. To accomplish this the application keeps a history of previous guesses (along with unexplored guesses) for each square as it goes, build a stack that it backtracks through whenever a dead-end is reached.

This resulted in a solution that could be visualized as a depth-first search: each guess at a square's correct value is a node on the tree, with the algorithm traversing the tree in a depth-first fashion with the goal of finding the chain of nodes that fills every square. This is akin to trying to find the longest chain in a given tree when the length of that chain is given, allowing you to stop as soon as you've found it.
### Why TypeScript?
I chose to use TypeScript because I wanted to refresh myself on the language and this seemed like a suitably small project that could leverage TypeScript's unique features. At the time I was working primarily with C#, so working on a web-adjacent project in my spare time was a refreshing change of pace. The other advantage of using TypeScript is that if I ever decide to attach this model to some sort of UI, it should be fairly straight-forward to build a web page to display its outputs.
